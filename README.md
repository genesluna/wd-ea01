# Project related to the discipline of Web Development at CESMAC college

### Project requirements:

- Step 1:
We should create a web page for managing users of a business. We must create a registration page with a form containing the following fields: Name; Email; Date of birth; Type of housing (House or Apartment - checkbox). HTML5 input types should be used.

- Step 2:
Add two buttons:
-> Save (in green color);
-> Clear (in red color).

- Step 3:
The text fields must have a 2px solid blue border and the page background should be gray (#f3f3f3).

### Project result:
I took the liberty of changing the colors and the size of the border a little to make the layout a bit more pleasant. In the case of choosing the type of housing, as the user must only choose a single option and following what I learned in the HCI course, I chose to use the 'radio' type instead of the 'checkbox' type.
